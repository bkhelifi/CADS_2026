## Session of Wednesday, 14h00/15h45
**Systematic uncertainties**

Made by Kirsty Feijen (APC, Paris) and Quentin Remy (IRAP, Toulouse). Location : room CIAS, Observatoire de Meudon

### Systematics uncertainties estimates from Jackniffe tests (data perturbations)
***Observation leave-k-out:***
 How sensitive is the fit to the removal of a randomly selected observation?
 
 Probes the stability of the fit with respect to observation-to-observation variability, including potential unknown systematic effects.
- Notebook : xxx

***Random FoV masking:***
 How sensitive is the fit to the removal of a randomly selected subset of the field of view?
 
 Probes the stability of the fit with respect to spatially localized systematic effects, such as diffuse-model mismatches, acceptance uncertainties, or residual background structures.
 - Notebook : xxx

### Systematic uncertainty propagation through model variations (model perturbations)
**Multi-instrument energy-scale systematic:**
How sensitive is the fit to uncertainties in the relative energy calibration of the instruments?

Probes the stability of the fit with respect to inter-instrument energy-scale systematic effects, such as calibration biases, atmospheric uncertainties, and instrumental response mismatches.
- Notebook : xxx

**Alternative diffuse and IRF models:**
 How sensitive are the source parameters to uncertainties in the diffuse emission, instrument response, and other model components?
 
 Propagates model-related systematic uncertainties by repeating the fit with alternative diffuse-emission models, or IRFs.
